# Install last versions of Nvim for ubuntu
I try install nvim in ubuntu but is old 6.X or thing and nvim-AppImage don't work with me

## setup the the path for nvim 
you can use any path you want i chose `.local/bin` in home

firs you need to install nvim-linux64.tar.gz from 
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases

after download the file you need to extract the file
use this command `tar xzvf nvim-linux64.tar.gz`
