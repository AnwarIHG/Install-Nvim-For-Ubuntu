# Install_last_versions_fo_Nvim_for_ubuntu
I try install nvim in ubuntu but is old 6.X or thing and nvim-AppImage don't work with me

firs you need to install nvim-linux64.tar.gz from 
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases

after download the file you need to extract the file
use this command "tar xzvf nvim-linux64.tar.gz"
